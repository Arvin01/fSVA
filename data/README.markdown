## Original Data Sources:

The data from this project are available in the `data` directory, and I recommend using those data as a starting point for reproducing this project. Those data files have been curated and put into a convenient, uniform format.

The data were originally obtained from two sources. GSE2990, GSE2603 and GSE2034 were obtained from the [Gene Expression Omnibus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) directly, originally as part of the Practical Effect of Batch on Genomic Prediction publication. Code for that project is also available on GitHub.

The remaining datasets were obtained from Hector Corrada-Bravo's [website](http://cbcb.umd.edu/~hcorrada/antiProfiles/). They were originally compiled for the publication referenced there. The code for how I preprocessed this data is in the `datasrc` folder -- however, the antiProfilesData.rda file is not included in this repository, and should instead be obtained from Hector's website.
